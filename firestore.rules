/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for GameSphere.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for personal data (shopping carts, wishlists, user profiles)
 * and allows public read access to game data. Reviews include userId and gameId for authorization.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /games/{gameId}: Publicly accessible game data.
 * - /users/{userId}: User profiles, accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - /users/{userId}/shopping_cart/{cartId}: Shopping carts, accessible only to the owning user.
 * - /users/{userId}/wishlist/{wishlistId}: Wishlists, accessible only to the owning user.
 * - /users/{userId}/library/{gameId}: User's purchased games, accessible only to the owning user.
 * - /reviews/{reviewId}: Reviews, with userId and gameId for authorization.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is implicitly disallowed (no rule for listing the /users collection).
 * - Write operations on the /games collection are implicitly denied (no `allow write` rule).
 * - Reviews include the `userId` and `gameId` so we can validate ownership and enable listing reviews for a specific game.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Reviews store both `userId` and `gameId` to enable efficient security rules without needing to fetch related documents.
